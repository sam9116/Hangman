# Hangman

As the title suggests, this is hangman. It's a standard uwp app running on Windows 10 Build 10240.

There is two modes - Online and Offline

In offline mode, one person sets up the words and hints, the other person guesses. Person guessing the game gets 6 tries before the neck gets snaped. 

In online mode, only one person is needed, the player enters a name to keep track for highscores, words are pulled from randomword.com and the definition used as hints. the rest of the game follows offline mode, except everyround of game the player wins, the score increases by one on the leaderboards, which can be checked on my personal site
